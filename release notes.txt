3.0.0 (Alpha three series Initial Release)
- Sound is in. You should hear music. There is no sound other than one song that loops forever.
- Multithreading is in.
- Rubble and shovelling it.
- Bug fixes!
- Optimisations!
- Other stuff.
- The screen may flicker. If it is a problem, try to reduce the GFPS (edit data/game.cfg) or the FPS cap.
- Feel free to mod the game. Maps are in maps/ and the data files are in data/
- There are several unexplained bugs and random crashes. Please send us your entire gamelog.txt if you experience random crashes, or if you think you have found a bug.
- The mouse can be unresponsive at times. Especially in the windows version.
- Moving the camera around is not recommended if you are playing with a very high FPS cap. Works fine for me until around 300+ FPS.
