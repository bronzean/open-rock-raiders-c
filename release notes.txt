0.0.4
- Construction of walls is in.
- Construction of doors is in.
- Many, many bug fixes. Should be very stable!
- More optimisations.
- The screen may flicker, although this is rare for me in this release. If it is a problem, try to reduce the GFPS (edit data/game.cfg) or the FPS cap.
- Feel free to mod the game. Maps are in maps/ and the data files are in data/
- Please send us your entire gamelog.txt if you experience random crashes, or if you think you have found a bug.
- The mouse can be unresponsive at times. Especially in the windows version.
- Moving the camera around is not recommended if you are playing with a very high FPS cap. Works fine for me until around 300+ FPS.
