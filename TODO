Not necessarily in this order.

1. Look through the code and find the all the "TODO:"s, and do them.

4. Make a real map creator.

6. Un-hardcode pretty much everything that can (and should) be un-hardcoded.

13. Pathfinding...

14. Documentate the code.

16. Tell each tile (on creation) what the locations in the map array of the tiles to the left/right/up/down/diagonals are. If it is needed.

17. Texture reload button.

21. Allow tabs to seperate tile IDs in the map files.

22. Port buildings to new system.

28. Program liquids.

30. Program collecting resources and using them.

31. Program vehicles.

32. If you click and hold, have raider follow cursor.

34. Allow changing resolutions and between fullscreen and window mode while in-game.

37. Unhardcode tile size.

40. Make a 'load level' button on the title screen.

41. Create a job que...

42. Currently, the number of tools a unit can start out carrying is hard coded to 1. Change the limit to the unit's carrying capacity.

43. Add a carrying capacity to units.

44. When a unit is selected, make it show all the tools it's carrying, and all the Ore and Energy Crystals it's carrying.

45. Add a mass unit select feature.

46. Add a mass designation set feaure.

47. Add an ore and an energy crystal map.

48. Add support for "drilling ground".

50. Make units pick up ore and energy crystals.

51. Implement temperature maps.

52. Implement temperature.

54. Display a message saying, "Whee, moving." while a unit is moving.

57. Seems to me something in the install scripts or run scripts messed up. Fix whatever's wrong.
NOTE: After further testing, running sudo orr-c works. Remove the need for sudo so that you don't need to be root to play ORR.

59. Pretty up the interface.

61. Update the unit select function to use the ID grabbed by the left click check in the update loop.

63. Create popup menus.

64. Make the draw_inventory function of the unit draw the text on top of the map.
//Little idea on how to do it...
SDL_Surface *inventory_spr = null;
draw(0, 0, inventory_message_spr, inventory_spr);
draw_all_carried_items_onto_inventory_spr_too();
//Now, in interface update or something...
draw(0, SCREEN_HEIGHT - inventory_spr->h, inventory_spr, screen);

//Another idea:
//When assigning units their tools, add the unit to a draw_sprite_on_top que or something.

65. Um...Use zlib for memory compression or something?

67. Certain places could do better with the for being changed to a while.

68. In the terrain.cfg files and the rest, make the [] part be used as the ID of the object.

69. Make which worker/helper threads are reserved for what controlled by the config file.

71. Multithreading works now! BUT. The screen likes to flicker. Fix this. And, when using wasd to move the camera around, it likes to fly thousands of pixels in the specified direction...

72. Add a pthreads_trylock() thing to every spot where something is drawn to the screen?

74. Unhardcode tile size! - Yes, emphasized...

75. Create a thread that handles keypresses...
Maybe for checking repeating keypresses, do this:
//--------------
int ms_for_repeat; //or frames...or seconds...

run_keycheck_thread()
{
	if(keystates(keyname) && can_repeat == true)
	{
		can_repeat = false;
		do_stuff();
	}
	if(write_something_to_check_if_its_time_to_make_something_that_can_set_can_repeat_to__true)
	{
		can_repeat = true;
	}
}
//--------------



78. Add animations all over the place. Everybody likes eye candy!

80. Time based messages, in addition to the current frame based ones.

81. Allow -1 to be accepted as a value for number of threads. It lets the game know that it can use an infinite number of threads.

82. Plop all the unit's stuff that require the unit to be selected into it's own broad check. Saves on some cpu later on when many units are in the level.

84. Here's a bug: If, in the config file, I change GENERATE_ORE_ON_MINE to false, it still thinks it's set to true. Fix this bug.

87. Add the option for mouse scrolling. And don't forget to limit how far offscreen the camera can move if mouse scrolling is enabled.

91. Change all the tile types, unit types, tool types, etc, to be stored in a std::map. Unless it's better to just stick with vectors...

92. Change the Map itself to be stored in a std::map with ID as their key?

93. Raider walking animations.

94. Raider walking around in the tile...

95. Make it easy to handle multiple raiders on a tile.

96. Raider activity animations.

97. Basic constructions.

98. Advanced constructions.

99. Buildings.

100. Bases.

101. Make a constructions menu.

102. Implement that job que.

103. Implement that "ore on map" thing.

104. Program stockpiles.

105. Change the bool mining and all similar stuff in units to use the job_state variable.

106. The reason the game kept crashing when there was the "SDL_FreeSurface" thing in the unit's deconstructor was that it was freeing the actual image from the unit type. So, make sure to free all the surfaces at the end of the program and only in the unit type. For each individual unit, simply set the surface pointer to NULL.

107. Exception handling.

108. Use auto_ptr...

109. Check to make sure that the tile doesn't have an existing construction on it.

110. Combine client and server. How? Same thing as with 3D and 2D mode. bool server

111. Allow for switching of 3d and 2d gfx ingame.

112. Allow walls, objects, everything, to be dynamically changed graphically. For example, as the raider drills, the wall gets actual cracks in 3D mode. Not just lines in the texture. When a wall collapses, account for all the pieces.

113. The network update thread in the server pauses whenever a client connects. Fix this.

114. The server needs a better interface

115. Write a wrapper for the client socket. It contains the client socket itself, and data on it, like the team the client belongs to and whatnot.

116. Get clients connecting and send them the info they need.

117. Create a "lobby" screen (to replace the current game menu) to set options.

118. Write my own sdl_ttf sort of thing.

119. Create a global cfg parsing function that reads all the values into a vector of value classes then returns that to the caller for the caller to use it for whatever. Make sure to add a "verbose" option.

120. Rewrite new to allocate virtual memory on the hard drive once RAM is full. If enabled in the cfg.

121. Messages stay onscreen one frame too long. Fix this

122. Create a drawing manager that allows for depth drawing. THis way, interface will always be on top.

---------Releases-------------
End of 2010 alpha:
Finish pathfinding. Reimplement buildings. Implement mining. Reimplement teleporting. Implement simple level goals. Implement 'load map'. Implement a better UI.
And whatever else we can do before christmas/new years.
Results: Buildings not re-implemented. Mining implemented. Teleporting not reimplemented. Simple level goals not implemened. 'load map' not implemented. A better UI did, sort of, get implemented.
