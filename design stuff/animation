So, how will 2D animation work? Time to find out.



Unit Shovelling:

This seems the easiest.
So, have a file, "shovel_animation.2dap". (2da stands for 2d animation properties)
In it, have things like, "[NUM_FRAMES](5)", "[IMG_SRC_FOLDER](shovel_animation)"

First one, of course, lets the game know how many frames there are.

Second one, which you may have guessed, is the path to the folder containing all the images involved in the animation.
So, here's how that would look:

In the folder "shovel_animation", the following files exist:
1.png
2.png
3.png
4.png
5.png

See what's happening? Yes, the names are not configurable, but you're just gonna have to deal with that.
Support for .gif animations? Eh...Maybe. Dunno if I will...

Another idea: Something regarding optimisations...

Have a global animation list. All object types add their animations to this list. Then they simply have a vector that contains the index of all the entries of all the animations that belongs to them.
