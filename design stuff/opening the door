How does this work?

If the door is unlocked, the unit simply walks up to it, tells it to open, and waits for it to open. Then, lastly, it'll probably walk through.
 * Idea: Select door. Button appears: "Open door". Click that. Unit walks up to it. Opens it for you. IT'S BRILLIANT I SAY.

If the door is locked, it'll have to get unlocked somehow. Then the unit can open it, and walk through or whatever.
