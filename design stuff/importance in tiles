When a tile is flagged unimportant, it is not updated; it's update function is skipped.

Two ways to do this. At the top of the update function, add a check to see if it's important.
Or keep an array of all important tiles...

At the end of the map parser, importance is set for all tiles.
Simply being onscreen flags the importace flag.

When the camera moves, a variable is set and all tils check if they went on or off, and importance is set accordingally.
