When the server is started up, the "Lobby" is entered.
From here, clients are managed, the game options are set up, etc.
Once everything is ready, whoever's behind the server hits the "start game" button.

Now, when you look at the server's window, you see a "god" view of the level.
The user even has access to "god" commands to make the game interesting or whatever if they want.

How is data transferred?
First, the level is transferred to the clients.
Second, the clients ask the server for updates on what's going on at the interval the server specifies.
This part right here could be done with a thread that delays for specified ms and then sends request to server after the delay.

Remember, server does all the calculations. All client does is act as an interface to the game for the player.
