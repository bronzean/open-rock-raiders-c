Mining has two methods:

A hotkey, '4', for example.
You select the raider, then press '4', then click on a wall.

And, a button.
You select a raider, left click on the button, then left click on the wall.


If ore is generated and what type is generated is determined by the specific wall.


How drill times work: 

Each drill has a drill rate.
Each wall has "health". 
Every frame, the drill inflicts its drill rate on the wall.
if(wall_health <= 0) { collapse(); }

Each drillable tile has a "drill time multiplier" thing. For example:
A value of 0.5 means all tools drill that tile at half of their drill rate.
A value of 2 means they drill that tile twice as fast as their drill rate.
