So, when looking for, for example, the tile that the mouse just clicked...
//-------------------
bool done = false;
bool found = false;
int i = Map.size() / 2;

while(!done)
{
	if(Map[i].clicked == true)
	{
		found = true;
		done = true;
		id_of_clicked_tile = i;
	}
	else
	{
		//Blargh, here it sort of falls apart.
		//What needs to be done:
		//In a simple form, you'd jump to the halfway point in the range of possible values. And keeping doing that till you land on the value you're looking for.
	}
}
