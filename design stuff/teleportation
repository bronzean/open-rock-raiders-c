There are several essential parts related to teleportation. Let's get started.

First off, the LMS must have a teleport beacon to lock on to.
The strength of the beacon plus the strength of the LMS's teleporter affects the precision of the teleporter.
See, there's a random chance that the teleport will fail and the raider may end up anywhere.
Normally, though (as failure rarely happens when both are stronger), there's simply a radius that the unit will teleport into from the beacon.
The radius is determined by the strengths of the LMS's teleporter and the beacon's signal strength. Lower radius = greater precision = better.
There's also a small chance of failure here too, that the unit will teleport into a wall, thus destroying the wall and themselves.

Anyway, the global teleport que variable is a vector of strings.
The string is composed of:
 "type.id"
So, for example,
 "unit.0"
would mean, "This qued entity is a unit with type id 0."

How does the game know where to send units? There are two methods of requesting the teleportation of units.
1. Set a default teleporter and click on the global teleport button (the teleport button that's always there). A unit will teleport to the default teleporter.
2. Select a teleporter and use its teleport button (the teleport button that appears when a teleporter is selected). A unit will be teleported to it.
