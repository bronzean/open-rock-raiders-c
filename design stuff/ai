string status;

What is that ^? That let's the game know what the unit currently is doing.

If the unit's status is "IDLE", then check all the jobs in the job que. When it finds something it is allowed to do, then it does it.
If it finds nothing, it then checks if it is allowed to pick up random resources laying around. If it is, it goes and picks up something.
Finding something it can do is defined as: Finding a hob that it's ai options allow it to do. FOr example, it'll only collect ore automatically if it's ai options say, "You can automatically collect ore".
Checking if it is allowed to pick up resources is defined as the following: It's ai options allow it, and it can hold said resource.
