For drawing air tiles:

Every tile has the following variable:
/* ------------ */
int tile_below;
/* ------------ */

When the map is loaded,
/* ------------ */
if(new_tile.layer != 0) //If the tile is not on the botomn of the map.
{
	new_tile.tile_below = fetch_tile_below(); //Grab the index of the tile below.
}
/* ------------ */

Possibly how the fetch_tile_below function would look:
/* ------------ */
new_tile.tile_below = ID - (num_col_objects * num_row_objects * num_layers);
/* ------------ */
This is not actually a function. I simply showed it as being a function earlier becuase...Becuase I felt like it?

Drawing idea(s):
Overlay the sprite drawn with a fog.
Make the sprite smaller.

Well, here's something that requires thought:
Draw several of the tiles next to the tile under the air tile. And resize them all to be smaller. And overlay with fog.
