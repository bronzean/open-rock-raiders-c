So, movement speed affects how fast you travel...
There should be "work speeds" which determine how fast something completes a specified job.

For example:

A shovelling speed of 10 means that unit shovels at a rate of the specified damage every 10 frames.
A shovelling speed of 5 means that unit shovels at a rate of the specified damage every 5 frames.
Here, shovelling is defined as "using your tool".
So, said unit uses their tool once every x_speed frames.
