Build up a base and defend it from hordes of enemies.
At least tool store or something must survive.

~ Idea given my Amauros.


Extention:
No mining. Map would be generated in fasion similar to minecraft (to prevent the potential of players filling up the cave with buildings); resources would be tleported in to the toolstore every so often and refiners would give bonuses to that rate.

~ Still credit to Amauros :P
