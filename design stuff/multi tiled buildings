[7:30:25 AM PDT] Ciprian: See, the next step is to incorparte buildings/bases
[7:31:42 AM PDT] Ciprian: You got any ideas codewise?
[7:32:08 AM PDT] Ciprian: Should a building be a bunch of smaller buildings connected together and functioning as one entity?
[7:32:25 AM PDT] Ciprian: Kind of like how a car has all these different parts working together to create a car
[7:35:05 AM PDT] Jared Amos: Hm, maybe we could have the main building which does a basic function. It can be upgraded to perform that function better. And then there are add-ons that have to be built next to the main building or a connector. The connectors being like an extension cord for the add-ons, so more than 4 can be installed. The add-ons further improve functionality or add new more advanced functions.
[7:35:38 AM PDT] Ciprian: Hmm...Building upgrades also being visual
[7:35:39 AM PDT] Ciprian: Nice
[7:35:47 AM PDT] Ciprian: only the mining laser had that in RR
[7:35:56 AM PDT] Ciprian: Now here's the problem
[7:35:59 AM PDT] Ciprian: how is it done codewise?
[7:36:32 AM PDT] Ciprian: class building
{
public:
int parent_id;
vextor<int> child_id;
bool is_parent;
}
[7:36:47 AM PDT] Ciprian: Maybe having each componenet have those variables?
[7:36:56 AM PDT] Ciprian: If it's a parent, it controls the building
[7:37:06 AM PDT] Ciprian: If it's a child, it's function is mainly asthetic
[7:37:26 AM PDT] Ciprian: Maybe it can be used to determine where tools are taken from, for example
[7:37:31 AM PDT] Ciprian: or where ore is deposited
[7:37:36 AM PDT] Ciprian: or where ECs are deposited...
[7:37:42 AM PDT] Ciprian: But...I'mma write these two ideas down

Actually, better idea:
A building is a linked list of pointers to the tiles that contain it and the constructions that compose it.
It also has a linked list consisting of pointers to all its constructions.

How do you get from constructions to buildings? Easy!
Simply click the "Assign building" button, and left click on every tile you want to add.
Optionally, left click on a corner, right click on the other corner, and all tiles in that area will be selected.
Use ctrl + left click to remove the tile you clicked on, and ctrl + left click in a corner followed by ctrl + right click in the other corner to remove all tiles in between those two.
