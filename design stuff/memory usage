The map should be compressed. 127 mb at a million tile map in classic mode is all right.
Several gigs for a tiny planet U in world sim mode is not ok.
Actually, maybe there's a better way to save on memory usage without dropping features. If so, find it and implement it.


Idea:
Load and unload different parts of the map as neccessary.
