This is the main cfg file

Anything outside of brackets is a comment

Here's how it works. You type the variable,
SCREEN_WIDTH
For example, then you type a value after it in parentheses. As you will see later down in the CFG





--------------------------------------GENERAL SETTINGS-------------------------

The screen Width and height
SCREEN_WIDTH(800)
SCREEN_HEIGHT(600)

[SCREEN_WIDTH](1024)
[SCREEN_HEIGHT](700)

SCREEN_WIDTH(1600)
SCREEN_HEIGHT(900)

Run the game fullscreen?
[FULLSCREEN](FALSE)

What fps will the game be capped off at?
[FPS](25)
FPS](-1) A value of -1 means it will be unrestricted.
[GFPS](100) Updates the graphics once a second at a value of 1000. The lower it is, the higher the chance of flicker. If the flicker is bad, set it to something like 250...

The speed the camera moves at
[CAM_MOVE_SPEED](10)

Here we have the interface file's path.
[INTERFACE_CFG](data/interface1024x700.cfg)

[HELPER_THREADS](1) Specifies how many threads the game uses to help itself out. Set this to 0 if you are getting random crashes. Or are annoyed with any flickering that may occur.

[3D] This lets the game know we want to use 3D graphic.
