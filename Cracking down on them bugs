1. The teleportation/moving raiders thing.
So, randomally, when a raider, which you just teleported in, is issued a moveto command, the game will one too many entries to active_map. This extra addition is always an insanely large value.
Another weird thing that happened; One time, it populated the active map with several hundred entries. Each of these entries excess entries (save the last one), had a value of 0.
The last one had an insanely large value.

Very peculiar. Now take a look at this:
Left click
A popup menu's field has been clicked.
counter: 0
Value: 29
counter: 1
Value: 15
counter: 2
Value: 26
counter: 3
Value: 25

I see my moveto has been clicked.
Path to ramp found!
Position of new tile: (320,32,0)
Index of new tile: 24
Transferring over selected unit status.
Entry (active_map.size() - 1): 4
Active_Map[Active_Map.size() - 1]: 24
Succesfully moved unit.

counter: 4
Value: 24

Deselected Rock Raider
counter: 5
Value: 0
counter: 6
Value: 1768711273

See?
Everything's fine at first. 3 entries in active_map. All have sane values.
Then this:
I see my moveto has been clicked.
Path to ramp found!
Position of new tile: (320,32,0)
Index of new tile: 24
Transferring over selected unit status.
Entry (active_map.size() - 1): 4
Active_Map[Active_Map.size() - 1]: 24
Succesfully moved unit.

That's right.
It adds itself as the 4th entry into active_map, and it has a sane value.

...And then, somewhere along the line,
counter: 4
Value: 24

Deselected Rock Raider
counter: 5
Value: 0
counter: 6
Value: 1768711273
Segmentation fault

There, the tile we just added. But wait, what's that second part?
Counter shoulda stopped at 4. Somewhere along the line, an additional entry was added to active_map, and it contains the insane value of "1768711273".
