Not necessarily in this order.

1. Look through the code and find the all the "TODO:"s, and do them.

2. Un-hardcode pretty much everything that can (and should) be un-hardcoded.

3. Documentate the code.

4. The server needs a better interface

5. Write a wrapper for the client socket. It contains the client socket itself, and data on it, like the team the client belongs to and whatnot.

6. Get clients connecting and send them the info they need.

7. Create a "lobby" screen (to replace the current game menu) to set options.

8. Currently, port_number is reset to the default, for some odd reason. Fix this.
