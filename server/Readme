Compiling
---------------------
Dependencies:
SDL 1.2,
SDL_image,
SDL_TTF
SDL_mixer
pthreads (Also known as posix?)
SDL_net
I'f I'm forgetting anything, please let me know.


Windows users:
Use cygwin. This is what I'm using to compile the windows versions.

Linux users:
CD to directory in a terminal and type 'make'.

Note: If you just updated your source code, (like did a "svn update" or something), then make sure to do a full compile. In linux, type:
make
make clean
In windows...If you're using cygwin...same thing.


Installation
---------------------
Ya, no install. Run the thing directly.

If you want ORR to play midi files:
Download http://www.libsdl.org/projects/mixer/timidity/timidity.tar.gz
Extract the contents of midi_stuff.zip into /usr/local/lib under UNIX/LINUX, and C:\ under Win32.

How to use this thing
---------------------
Read the manual. (File with same name in this directory.)

Modding
---------------------
There's not much to mod, but if you insist that badly, open up the data folder and explore it.
Maps can be found in the maps folder.
